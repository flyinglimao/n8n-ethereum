# ERC721

ERC721 resource provides operations for interacting with NFT (Non-Fungible Token) contracts.

## Overview

ERC721 is the standard for NFTs on Ethereum. Each token has a unique ID and represents a distinct asset.

## Operations

### Get Balance

Get the number of NFTs owned by an address.

**Required Credentials**: Ethereum RPC

**Parameters**:
- **Contract Address** (required): The ERC721 NFT contract address
- **Owner Address** (required): Address to check balance for

### Owner Of

Get the owner of a specific token ID.

**Required Credentials**: Ethereum RPC

**Parameters**:
- **Contract Address** (required): The ERC721 NFT contract address
- **Token ID** (required): The token ID to query

### Transfer From

Transfer an NFT to another address.

**Required Credentials**: Ethereum RPC, Ethereum Account

**Parameters**:
- **Contract Address** (required): The ERC721 NFT contract address
- **From** (required): Current owner address
- **To** (required): Recipient address
- **Token ID** (required): The token ID to transfer

### Safe Transfer From

Safely transfer an NFT with receiver validation.

**Required Credentials**: Ethereum RPC, Ethereum Account

**Parameters**:
- **Contract Address** (required): The ERC721 NFT contract address
- **From** (required): Current owner address
- **To** (required): Recipient address
- **Token ID** (required): The token ID to transfer

### Approve

Approve another address to transfer a specific NFT.

**Required Credentials**: Ethereum RPC, Ethereum Account

**Parameters**:
- **Contract Address** (required): The ERC721 NFT contract address
- **Spender** (required): Address to approve
- **Token ID** (required): The token ID to approve

### Set Approval For All

Approve an operator to manage all NFTs.

**Required Credentials**: Ethereum RPC, Ethereum Account

**Parameters**:
- **Contract Address** (required): The ERC721 NFT contract address
- **Operator** (required): Address to approve
- **Approved** (required): true to approve, false to revoke

### Get Approved

Get the approved address for a token.

**Required Credentials**: Ethereum RPC

**Parameters**:
- **Contract Address** (required): The ERC721 NFT contract address
- **Token ID** (required): The token ID to query

### Is Approved For All

Check if an operator is approved for all tokens.

**Required Credentials**: Ethereum RPC

**Parameters**:
- **Contract Address** (required): The ERC721 NFT contract address
- **Owner** (required): Owner address
- **Operator** (required): Operator address

### Token URI

Get the metadata URI for a token.

**Required Credentials**: Ethereum RPC

**Parameters**:
- **Contract Address** (required): The ERC721 NFT contract address
- **Token ID** (required): The token ID to query

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "tokenURI": "ipfs://QmXxxx.../1"
}
```

## Common Use Cases

### Monitor NFT Ownership

```
[Ethereum Trigger: Event] → [Owner Of] → [Check Owner] → [Action]
```

### Automated NFT Transfer

```
[Trigger] → [Safe Transfer From] → [Wait For Transaction] → [Notification]
```

### Check NFT Metadata

```
[Trigger] → [Token URI] → [Fetch Metadata] → [Display]
```

## Tips

- **Safe Transfer**: Prefer Safe Transfer From to prevent NFTs being sent to contracts that can't handle them
- **Token IDs**: Usually sequential but can be any uint256 value
- **Metadata**: Token URI typically points to JSON metadata (often on IPFS)
- **Approval**: Set Approval For All is commonly used for marketplace interactions
