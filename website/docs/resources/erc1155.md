# ERC1155

ERC1155 resource provides operations for interacting with multi-token contracts.

## Overview

ERC1155 is a multi-token standard that can represent both fungible and non-fungible tokens in a single contract.

## Operations

### Balance Of

Get the balance of a specific token ID for an address.

**Required Credentials**: Ethereum RPC

**Parameters**:
- **Contract Address** (required): The ERC1155 contract address
- **Account** (required): Address to check balance for
- **Token ID** (required): The token ID to query

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "balance": "10"
}
```

### Balance Of Batch

Get balances for multiple accounts and token IDs in one call.

**Required Credentials**: Ethereum RPC

**Parameters**:
- **Contract Address** (required): The ERC1155 contract address
- **Accounts** (required): Array of addresses
- **Token IDs** (required): Array of token IDs

### Safe Transfer From

Transfer a single token type to another address.

**Required Credentials**: Ethereum RPC, Ethereum Account

**Parameters**:
- **Contract Address** (required): The ERC1155 contract address
- **From** (required): Sender address
- **To** (required): Recipient address
- **Token ID** (required): The token ID to transfer
- **Amount** (required): Amount to transfer
- **Data** (optional): Additional data

### Safe Batch Transfer From

Transfer multiple token types in a single transaction.

**Required Credentials**: Ethereum RPC, Ethereum Account

**Parameters**:
- **Contract Address** (required): The ERC1155 contract address
- **From** (required): Sender address
- **To** (required): Recipient address
- **Token IDs** (required): Array of token IDs
- **Amounts** (required): Array of amounts
- **Data** (optional): Additional data

### Set Approval For All

Approve an operator to manage all tokens.

**Required Credentials**: Ethereum RPC, Ethereum Account

**Parameters**:
- **Contract Address** (required): The ERC1155 contract address
- **Operator** (required): Address to approve
- **Approved** (required): true to approve, false to revoke

### Is Approved For All

Check if an operator is approved.

**Required Credentials**: Ethereum RPC

**Parameters**:
- **Contract Address** (required): The ERC1155 contract address
- **Owner** (required): Owner address
- **Operator** (required): Operator address

### URI

Get the metadata URI for a token.

**Required Credentials**: Ethereum RPC

**Parameters**:
- **Contract Address** (required): The ERC1155 contract address
- **Token ID** (required): The token ID to query

## Common Use Cases

### Batch Token Transfer

```
[Trigger] → [Safe Batch Transfer From] → [Wait For Transaction] → [Notification]
```

### Check Multiple Balances

```
[Schedule Trigger] → [Balance Of Batch] → [Process Balances] → [Store]
```

## Tips

- **Batch Operations**: ERC1155 excels at batch operations, reducing gas costs
- **Multi-Token**: Can represent both fungible and non-fungible tokens
- **Gaming**: Popular for gaming items and in-game currencies
- **Efficiency**: More gas-efficient than ERC721 for multiple tokens
